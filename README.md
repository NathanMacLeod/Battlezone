# Battlezone
Project for my second semester in AP computer science. I tried to re-create the arcade game Battlezone from 1980 in Java. Made around april/may 2018.

I had messed with some experiments in 3d, but this was the first actual 3d game I have made. For drawing in 3d, transformation matrices about the prinicpal axis
are used to rotate points. Since most objects don't leave the plane, a lot of the game logic actually just functions in 2d.

# Build

* run 'package' target
* cd \<project root\>/target
* java -jar battlezone-1.0.jar
